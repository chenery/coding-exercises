4 - [Arrays] Jumping on the Clouds
5 - [Strings] Counting the a's in an infinitely repeating string
6 - [Strings] Making anagrams

For frequency counts, can use an array if the keys are known and in a limited range, rather than a HashMap

8 - [Arrays] Left rotation
9 - [Arrays] 2D Array - Maximum hourglass
10 - [Sorting] Maximum number of toys to buy

[todo] Able to discuss Java's Arrays.sort implementation...

11 - [Hash Tables] Encode secret message
12 - [Hash Tables] Common substring between 2 strings
13 - [Trees] Height of a binary tree

BFS using recursion

14 - [Trees] Binary Search Tree: Lowest common ancestor

Need to understand the the lca of nodes v1 and v2 is v3 where v1 < v3 < v2.

15 - [Linked Lists] Reverse a doubly linked list

Can be done simply by pointer swapping

16 - [Linked Lists] Find merge point of two lists
17 - [Linked Lists] Inserting a node into a sorted doubly linked list
18 - [Linked Lists] Insert at a specific position
19 - [Recursion] Fibonacci Numbers

Be able to produce the tabulated dynamic programming variant, also memoized version, and iterative version.

20 - [Strings] Character frequencies

Remember Java characters can be maps to from zero integers by doing char - 'a', same for numbers char - '0', due to ascii table.

21 - [Strings] Special substrings
22 - [Strings] Common child

Longest common substring - basic solution is recursive and optimally solved by dynamic programming tabulation.

23 - [Strings] Abbreviation

Dynamic programming tabulation - [todo] complete this for all cases

24 - [Arrays] Queue position swapping
25 - [Arrays] Minimum swaps to sort array
26 - [Arrays] Searching for difference pairs
27 - [Hash Tables] Frequency queries

Pre-initialise Java HashMaps with size appropriate for improved performance

28 - [Hash Tables] Ice cream shop
29 - [Hash Tables] Count triplets

Smart use of 2 Maps to maintain frequencies counts during a single pass of the data.

30 - [Hash Tables] Count substring anagrams

Need to know binomial formula - N choose X. And that simplifies for N choose 2 = N * (N - 1) / 2

31 - [Sorting] Fraudulent activities notifications

Need to know Counting sort, and understand using prefix sum to work out the median value.
